								<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
							</header>
							<h4>
								Court booking App for easy scheduling - Both the Players as well as Club Employee should
								have access to booking the Court. </h4>
							<br>
							<p> When few of my developer friends faced with a
								problem of calling and booking a court at a nearby club,
								we decided on creating an App that would solve this problem.
								We also came to know that all the members of the Tennis club as well as the
								Club team had the same issue. So we decided to tackle this problem by creating an App.

								<h3>Pain Points and Users</h3>

							<h4>
								Player:
							</h4>
							<p>"I have to call the Tennis Club for reserving a Court, most of the times my calls are
								unattended and
								when they call me back my favourite Courts are already booked!"
							</p>
							<p>"Is there a way I can train members in the sport I am good at?"</p>
							<h4>Club Employee:</h4>
							<p>"We get calls all the time and we are unable to keep track of the scheduling of Courts,
								also
								the regular players in the Club keep complaining of not able to get the Courts the
								prefer"

							</p>

							<h4>In order to address the above pain-points I came up with the following Users</h4>

							</header>
							<li>Members - Players who belong to a club and want to book slots in a Court</li>
							<li>Non-Members - Guest Players who want to book the Court one time </li>
							<li>Admin - Management/Employees of the Club who will book the courts on behalf of Players
							</li>
							<li>Coach - Certified trainers who are the members of the club and would like to train
								Players</li>

								<h4>User Research and additional features</h4>
							</header>


							<p>After discussion with 6 members of the Club and 2 of the Club Managers,
								we decided to add few more features to the app like Creating a Tournament,
								finding a game partner and creating game groups within the App
						</p>
							<p>Each user had a different set access to various activities that can be performed by the
								App</p>

							<p>There would be 4 different Personas using this App as per the checklist</p>
