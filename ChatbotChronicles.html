						<h4>Case Study: Chatbot for CommonFloor Real Estate Portal (2014)</h4>
					</header>

					<b>Overview:</b>
					<p>
						In 2014, CommonFloor, one of India’s leading real estate platforms, sought to improve user
						engagement and streamline the property search process. Collaborating with the CommonFloor
						product
						and engineering teams, I conceptualized and designed a chatbot that served as a static virtual
						assistant to simplify navigation and decision-making for prospective property buyers and
						renters.
					</p>

					<b>Objective:</b>
					<p>
						To design a chatbot experience that:
					<ul>
						<li>Simplifies property search for users unfamiliar with online real estate platforms.</li>
						<li>Provides curated property recommendations based on user inputs.</li>
						<li>Reduces user dropout rates caused by overwhelming property listings.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<b>User Research:</b>
					<p>
						<i>Target Audience:</i> First-time homebuyers and renters, typically aged 25–40, with limited
						familiarity with digital tools.
					</p>
					<p><i>Insights Gathered:</i></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Users were overwhelmed by the extensive listings and filters on the platform.</li>
						<li>Many preferred guided interactions rather than open-ended searches.</li>
						<li>A significant number of users abandoned the search due to difficulty in finding relevant
							properties quickly.</li>
					</ul>

					<b>Challenges:</b>
					<ul>
						<li><i>Navigation Complexity:</i> Simplifying the process for users unfamiliar with real estate
							terminologies.</li>
						<li><i>Fixed Inputs:</i> The chatbot was limited to rule-based interactions and couldn’t process
							free-form user queries.</li>

							guided
							interactions.</li>
						<li><i>Search Efficiency:</i> 30% faster property searches due to the streamlined flow.</li>
						<li><i>Conversions:</i> Improved lead generation as users were more likely to submit inquiries
							after
							interacting with the chatbot.</li>
					</ul>

					<b>Key Learnings:</b>
					<ul>
						<li><i>Simplicity Wins:</i> A guided, rule-based approach outperformed open-ended search for
							novice
							users.</li>

						<b>3. Healthcare App (2024):</b>
						<p>The most recent project I worked on was the healthcare app, which took chatbot technology to
							new
							heights by incorporating AI-driven, personalized healthcare suggestions. The challenge here
							was
							balancing the intelligence of the AI with user privacy, as healthcare data is sensitive. It
							was an
							exciting challenge to integrate proactive assistance—like health reminders and appointment
							scheduling—into the app, while ensuring that the app remained accessible for all user
							demographics.
							This project not only strengthened my AI design skills but also taught me how critical data
							security
							is when dealing with sensitive health information.</p>

						<b>Key Takeaways:</b>
						<ul>
							<li><i>Personalization: AI-driven solutions can transform healthcare by offering tailored
									care plans
									and proactive assistance.</i></li>
							<li><i>Privacy and security: Maintaining trust through strict data security measures is
									paramount,
									especially in healthcare.</i></li>
							<li><i>Intuitive user interface: An accessible design is essential for ensuring users can
									easily
									interact with complex AI systems.</i></li>
						</ul>

						<b>Conclusion:</b>
						<p>These three projects have not only refined my technical skills but have also deepened my
							understanding of how AI can enhance user experiences. I have learned that the key to
							successful
							chatbot design lies in simplicity, adaptability, and context-awareness. While my early
							projects
							focused on rule-based systems, my later experiences have shown me the power of more dynamic,
							personalized AI systems.</p>

						<p>Looking ahead, I am excited to continue exploring how AI and chatbots can provide even more
							personalized, intuitive experiences in different industries. From real estate to finance to
							healthcare, the potential for improving user experiences with AI is immense, and I am eager
							to
							contribute to this ever-evolving field.</p>
