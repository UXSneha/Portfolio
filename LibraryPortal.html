					<p>The Accenture Library is a treasure trove of knowledge designed to empower employees with
						resources to enhance their skill sets, expand their vocabulary, deepen their knowledge, or
						simply unwind with a good read. With a wealth of online resources available 24/7 to all active
						employees, the library serves as an invaluable tool for professional and personal growth.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, many employees were unaware of this rich resource within the organization. To address
						this challenge, we embarked on a journey to increase awareness and accessibility by reimagining
						the library portal. This redesign includes a more intuitive web portal and the creation of a
						mobile app featuring frequently accessed URLs, ensuring employees can seamlessly engage with
						library resources anytime, anywhere.</p>

						<h3>Empathize</h3>
						<h4>Understanding the User’s World</h4>
					</header>
					<p>
						<li>Our primary goal was to increase awareness among employees about the library's existence.
						</li>
						<li>The target users were the company's internal employees.</li>
						<li>We identified newsletters as an effective medium for spreading awareness using the employee
							mailing list.</li>
						<li>Posters were strategically placed across the company to ensure accessibility of key
							information.</li>
						<li>Team events and contests were organized within the library or promoted via newsletters to
							engage employees.</li>
					</p>

						<h4>MY ROLE DURING THIS PHASE: (1ST SPRINT)</h4>
					</header>


					<li>Designing the posters with the company's branding to be printed out and displayed in all
						accessible
						employee assembling areas
					</li>
					<li>Responsible to design the newsletter template and share across to the project manager who would
						be
						sending to the employee mailing list
					</li>
					<li>I also designed contest circulars for Library events
					</li>
					<br>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/LP/Lib1.png" alt="" /></span>

					<p>The posters were printed and displayed across the company. I prepared the newsletter template and
						it
						was shared across every Monday - called "Motivational Mondays"! There were several contests
						going
						through mail like crosswords etc., and the library portal was now under good usage. Here
						is when our second sprint started. The Library portal website started getting hits and the
						employees
						started visiting the library. </p>


					<header class="major">
						<h3>02 USER RESEARCH </h3>
					</header>
					<h4><br>
						<li>

							STAKEHOLDER MEETING</li>
					</h4>

					<p>We met with the teams to which was responsible of the portal development the business requirement
						was
						"To Increase the employees' awareness of the existence of the library and utilization of the
						available facilities provided to the employees."
					</p>
					<h4>
						<li>
							USER INTERVIEWS</li>
					</h4>
					<p>First, we conducted the initial in-person interviews with the employees who came to visit the
						library. We chose 6 participants representing different requirement and career aspirations. </p>
					<h4>
						<li> PERSONAS </li>
					</h4>
					<p>I came up with three personas based on the user research.
						Mary, Peter and Joshua with different work experience, reading habits and need for the library.
					</p>

					<header class="major">
						<h3>03 DESIGN OPTIONS </h3>
					</header>
					<p>We started brainstorming different ideas and layouts. My main motive here was to do minimal
						changes
						to the existing portal design whilst making it easily accessible and user friendly. I began my
						design process with low fidelity sketches.
					</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/LP/Lib3.png" alt="" /></span>

						<h3>04 UI DESIGN
						</h3>
					</header>
					<!--<span class = "image fit">-->
					<p>Steps taken to re-design the website</p>
					<!--	</span>-->
					<p>Since we were re-designing the existing portal, I decided to go with the current typography,
						color
						palette and branding logos with some additional complementary fonts and colors that would
						enhance
						the user interaction. <br> <br>
						The Major user pain point for re-designed the website was:
					</p>
					<header class="major">
						<h4>BAD NAVIGATION</h4>
					</header>
					<p>I noticed that the website had complex and inconsistent navigation which caused the User to
						get confused with the Portal thus not making use of this website
					</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/LP/LP4.png" alt="" /></span>

					<p>After the sketches were ready, I met with the developers and discussed on the coding constraints
						and
						timelines. We decided to reuse of most of the existing components as it involved minimal changes
						to
						the existing code.
					</p>
					<p>After this phase, I started creating a prototype for testing. I used Invision Studio and Invision
						as
						it was easy to collaborate, being on the same page.
						Since the analytics found that the most clicked part of the website was borrowing, and most of
						our
						personas suggested this feature, I also created a mockup for a very basic App that would focus
						on
						borrowing and notification of due dates and availability of the resources.
					</p>

					<p>Most of my sketches and wireframes cannot be shared here due to Non Disclosure Policy.
						My Case study only consists of the design methods I used to solve the Problem at hand.
					</p>

					<header class="major">
						<h3>05 USABILITY TESTING:</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Before we went live with the changes, I've made a testing round in order to reveal possible
						usability
						problems. To better understand how users interact without newly changed portal, I conducted A/B
						Testing.
					</p>
					<li>We selected 12 employees to participate we asked them to select between the current and the
						modified
						portal
					</li>
					<li>The goal was to test the clarity of components and user experience

					</li>
					<li>We broke out our key performance indicators into tasks that could be clearly measured

					</li>
					<li>The employees gave great feedback including some prospects for improvement or upgrade of the
						current
						portal.
					</li>
					<p><br> <b><i> I also concluded how our personas would respond to the changes:</i>
							<br>Mary: </b>"I get notifications, and am able to track the resources I need!"
						<br><b>Peter:</b> "The search algorithm is better now and I know the site map and everything is
						accessible"
						<br><b>Joshua:</b> "I can publish my experience in the blog section and am able to guide interns
						outside my
						team as well"
					</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/LP/Lib2.png" alt="" /></span>


					<header class="major">
						<h3>06 PROJECT LEARNING:</h3>
					</header>
					<li>This was an end to end project which I was involved and got an exposure to every aspect of the
						design journey

					</li>
					<li>I learnt how simple standard changes to a huge website would enhance the aesthetics and improve
						the
						user experience

					</li>
					<li>Interaction with users during user research and usability testing and the importance of user
						feedback and pain points

					</li>
					<li>Overall it was this project that refined my design capabilities and made me more empathetic
