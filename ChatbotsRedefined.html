					<h4>Case Study: Chatbot for CommonFloor Real Estate Portal (2014)</h4>
				</header>

				<b>Overview:</b>
				<p>
					In 2014, CommonFloor, one of India’s leading real estate platforms, sought to improve user
					engagement and streamline the property search process. Collaborating with the CommonFloor product
					and engineering teams, I conceptualized and designed a chatbot that served as a static virtual
					assistant to simplify navigation and decision-making for prospective property buyers and renters.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Simplifies property search for users unfamiliar with online real estate platforms.</li>
					<li>Provides curated property recommendations based on user inputs.</li>
					<li>Reduces user dropout rates caused by overwhelming property listings.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<b>User Research:</b>
				<p>
					<i>Target Audience:</i> First-time homebuyers and renters, typically aged 25–40, with limited
					familiarity with digital tools.
				</p>
				<p><i>Insights Gathered:</i></p>
				<ul>

						interactions.</li>
					<li><i>Search Efficiency:</i> 30% faster property searches due to the streamlined flow.</li>
					<li><i>Conversions:</i> Improved lead generation as users were more likely to submit inquiries after
						interacting with the chatbot.</li>
				</ul>

				<b>Key Learnings:</b>
				<ul>
					<li><i>Simplicity Wins:</i> A guided, rule-based approach outperformed open-ended search for novice
						users.</li>
					<li><i>Iterative Design:</i> Continuous feedback loops ensured the chatbot met user expectations.
					</li>
					<li><i>Scalability:</i> While the chatbot succeeded as a static assistant, it highlighted the need
