                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>This project involved designing a DIY loan journey for a financial institution, focusing on
                        providing a seamless, self-service option for users. The goal was to empower customers to
                        complete the loan application process independently while ensuring that the user experience (UX)
                        met their emotional and functional needs. We aimed to compare three loan journey models: DIY (Do
                        It Yourself), Assisted (via support agent), and Manual (traditional in-person application).

                        This case study is linked to our broader exploration of AI-driven solutions for the financial
                        sector, as detailed in the Chatbot UX Case Study. The insights from that study helped inform our
                        approach to improving user interactions within the DIY loan journey.

                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p> Loan applications are often a complex, intimidating process for customers. The financial
                        institution wanted to introduce a DIY loan application journey that allowed users to apply for
                        loans independently through an online platform, with the option for assistance via a chatbot or
                        support agents when necessary. The challenge was to design an experience that was intuitive,
                        user-friendly, and emotionally supportive throughout the journey. </p>

                                    <h3>DIY Journey</h3>
                                    <p>In the DIY journey, users interact with the platform independently, making all decisions and filling in forms on their own. This model is the most efficient and empowering for users, offering autonomy and convenience. Users can progress at their own pace, minimizing wait times and maintaining full control of the loan process. It empowers users to complete each step without external assistance.</p>

                                    <h3>Assisted Journey</h3>
                                    <p>The Assisted Journey offers users guidance from a support agent who helps them through the process. While this provides reassurance, it can introduce delays due to the dependency on an available agent. Users still retain some control over their application, but waiting times and occasional loss of control can cause frustration. This model strikes a middle ground, offering assistance but at the cost of flexibility.</p>

                                    <h3>Manual Journey</h3>
                                    <p>The Manual Journey follows a traditional, face-to-face process where loan officers guide users through each step. While it provides human interaction and trust, it is often seen as time-consuming, inconvenient, and less efficient. Long wait times and the perceived lack of control make this model less favorable compared to the DIY or Assisted Journeys.</p>

                    <h3>Challenges and Iterations</h3>
                    <p>Translating complex regulations into user-friendly interfaces required multiple design
                        iterations. Usability testing revealed the need for better navigation and faster load times.</p>

                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>The project resulted in:</p>

                        <li>Positive feedback highlighting improved understanding and confidence of users in managing
                            their loan journeys.</li>
