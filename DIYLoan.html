                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>This project involved designing a DIY loan journey for a financial institution, focusing on
                        providing a seamless, self-service option for users. The goal was to empower customers to
                        complete the loan application process independently while ensuring that the user experience (UX)
                        met their emotional and functional needs. We aimed to compare three loan journey models: DIY (Do
                        It Yourself), Assisted (via support agent), and Manual (traditional in-person application).

                        This case study is linked to our broader exploration of AI-driven solutions for the financial
                        sector, as detailed in the Chatbot UX Case Study. The insights from that study helped inform our
                        approach to improving user interactions within the DIY loan journey.

                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p> Loan applications are often a complex, intimidating process for customers. The financial
                        institution wanted to introduce a DIY loan application journey that allowed users to apply for
                        loans independently through an online platform, with the option for assistance via a chatbot or
                        support agents when necessary. The challenge was to design an experience that was intuitive,
                        user-friendly, and emotionally supportive throughout the journey. </p>

                                <h3>DIY Journey</h3>
                                <p>In the DIY journey, users interact with the platform independently, making all
                                    decisions and filling in forms on their own. This model is the most efficient and
                                    empowering for users, offering autonomy and convenience. Users can progress at their
                                    own pace, minimizing wait times and maintaining full control of the loan process. It
                                    empowers users to complete each step without external assistance.</p>

                            <!-- Assisted Journey Column -->

                                <h3>Assisted Journey</h3>
                                <p>The Assisted Journey offers users guidance from a support agent who helps them
                                    through the process. While this provides reassurance, it can introduce delays due to
                                    the dependency on an available agent. Users still retain some control over their
                                    application, but waiting times and occasional loss of control can cause frustration.
                                    This model strikes a middle ground, offering assistance but at the cost of
                                    flexibility.</p>

                                <h3>Manual Journey</h3>
                                <p>The Manual Journey follows a traditional, face-to-face process where loan officers
                                    guide users through each step. While it provides human interaction and trust, it is
                                    often seen as time-consuming, inconvenient, and less efficient. Long wait times and
                                    the perceived lack of control make this model less favorable compared to the DIY or
                                    Assisted Journeys.</p>

                        <p>
                            To empathize with our users and tailor the design to their needs, we created
                            two key personas: the <strong>Customer</strong> and the <strong>Bank Manager</strong>.
                            Each persona represents a distinct user group with unique goals, challenges, and pain
                            points.
                        </p>

                                    <h2>Persona 1: Priya, the Loan Applicant (Customer)
                                    </h2>
                                    <p>Based on our research, including interviews, surveys, and usability tests, we
                                        developed a user persona for Priya, a 32-year-old professional from Bengaluru.
                                        Priya is tech-savvy and prefers managing her tasks online, especially when
                                        balancing work and family. She aims to complete her loan application smoothly
                                        and stay updated on its progress. Priya’s pain points include unclear
                                        application status, uncertainty about document submission, and excessive
                                        follow-ups. This persona helped us design an experience that prioritizes
                                        efficiency, clear communication, and a smooth, hassle-free process for loan
                                        applicants.</p>

                                        <p>Our research also led to the creation of Amit’s persona, a 45-year-old senior
                                            bank manager from Mumbai with over 15 years of experience. Amit oversees
                                            loan approvals and manages customer communication. His motivations include
                                            streamlining customer interactions and reducing repetitive tasks. Amit's
                                            challenges include juggling multiple systems and tabs, which leads to
                                            inefficiency. He values tools that enhance collaboration and speed up
                                            approvals. By understanding Amit’s frustrations and goals, we could ensure
                                            that our design would improve his workflow, communication, and overall
                                            efficiency in managing loan requests and customer interactions.
