				<p>As highlighted in my <a href="ChatbotChronicles.html#three">Chatbot Chronicles</a> case study, I
					worked extensively on designing an intuitive
					bot that facilitated seamless interactions between doctors and patients, supporting their medical
					consultations and data sharing needs. Here, I present my design process for MediConnect. I’ve kept
					the presentation as it is, as it provides a clear and comprehensive overview of my design approach.
				</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>The users of this product would include:</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Step 1: Understanding the problem</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>I began by conducting a brain dump, jotting down all the words and thoughts that came to mind when
					thinking about visiting a medical practitioner. During this phase, I worked closely with a
					multidisciplinary team, participating in brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and concepts for
					the healthcare application. Together, we explored a range of possibilities and crafted innovative
					solutions to tackle the challenges and pain points uncovered through user experience research.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/5.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Next, we mapped out the user journey, focusing on a scenario where Philip, a user, falls down and
					needs to plan a visit to the doctor. We outlined the steps Philip would take—from realizing the need
					for medical attention to scheduling an appointment. The goal was to create a smooth and intuitive
					process for users like Philip to quickly and easily seek medical help, with minimal friction,
					leveraging the app’s features to guide him through each step of the journey.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/6.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


				<p>Next, we designed a process flow that involved all key stakeholders: the doctor, the admin, and the
					patient. The flow illustrated how each stakeholder interacts with the system:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Patient:</b> Initiates the process by logging into the app, selecting the type of
						consultation needed, and scheduling an appointment with the doctor.</li>
					<li><b>Admin:</b> Manages the backend, ensuring that appointments are scheduled, patient data is
						correctly recorded, and doctors' availability is updated in real time.</li>
					<li><b>Doctor:</b> Receives appointment notifications, reviews patient information, and prepares for
						consultations, either through video or in-person. After the consultation, the doctor updates the
						patient’s records and provides prescriptions or follow-up care instructions.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This flow ensures that all parties are aligned and can efficiently communicate and complete their
					tasks, streamlining the medical consultation process.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/7.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>So far, we've explored the ideal scenario; now let's examine the pain points.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/8.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>The most effective approach would be to create a persona...</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/9.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/10.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Doctor Persona</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/11.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/12.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/13.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>I next moved to the research phase, where I conducted competitive research and explored emerging
					trends in the medical field, such as advancements in telemedicine, the integration of AI in
					diagnostics, and the growing demand for seamless patient experiences through digital health
					solutions</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/14.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>One quote that really resonated with me during this phase!</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/15.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Through my research, I uncovered several key insights, including the fact that 80% of patients prefer
					digital tools for managing their healthcare, and the global telemedicine market is expected to grow
					to $185.6 billion by 2026. These findings helped shape the design strategy and ensure alignment with
					current industry needs and user expectations.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/16.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Now, it's time to bring all the insights and research together into designs and prototyping—the phase
					I truly enjoy. This is where the concepts evolve into tangible, user-centered solutions, allowing me
					to craft intuitive interfaces and seamless experiences that address the needs of all stakeholders.
					It’s the part of the process where creativity and strategy meet, and I can see the design taking
					shape into something both functional and impactful.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/17.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/18.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>The ideal solution for a patient would be an app that makes reaching out to healthcare providers just
					a click away. To achieve this, I designed a user-friendly dashboard where all relevant information
					is easily accessible. This dashboard consolidates key features in one place, streamlining the
					process for users and ensuring they have a seamless experience when seeking medical assistance or
					managing their healthcare needs.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/19.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>For the doctor, it's essential to have a comprehensive, bird's-eye view of the patient's information
					on a desktop interface, ensuring that no detail or potential issue is overlooked. This allows the
					doctor to quickly assess the patient's history, current concerns, and treatment plan, empowering
					them to make informed decisions and provide effective care without missing any critical information.
				</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/20.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/21.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>The admin, on the other hand, would benefit from a tablet or desktop interface that provides an
					organized view of what's needed for smooth operations. This platform would allow the admin to easily
					manage appointments, track patient data, and oversee doctor availability, ensuring that everything
					is running efficiently and that all stakeholders have the information they need at a glance.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/22.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>After the paper sketching phase, I moved on to defining what would visually appeal to the user and
					how the information architecture would be structured to ensure a seamless experience. This phase was
					crucial in setting a strong foundation for the design.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/26.jpeg" alt="" /></span>



				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/23.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/24.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Additionally, as part of this project, I worked on integrating a chatbot that would assist users by
					providing quick access to medical information and services. This chatbot was designed to enhance the
					user experience by facilitating efficient interactions between patients and healthcare providers.
					You can explore more about this in my <a href="ChatbotChronicles.html#three">Chatbot Chronicles</a>
					case
					study.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/25.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Slide 26: Recommendations for future projects.</p>


				<p>For this project, I used Figma to bring everything together, and I'm excited
					to share the high-fidelity designs that emerged from this process</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/27.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>After the paper sketching phase, addressing the pain points, and creating the information
					architecture, I love diving into the next phase—playing with colors and refining the design. I
					typically mock up my designs using tools like Figma, and this project was no different. Figma
					allowed me to bring the designs to life with high fidelity, and here are the final designs that
					showcase the user-centric experience we aimed to create.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/28.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/29.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/30.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/31.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<ul>
					<p>After the project went live, I am unable to share the final mockups here, as we utilized our
						design
						system components and included elements covered under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). However,
						here are a few
						key learnings from this project:</p>

					<li><b>Importance of User-Centric Design:</b> The entire process reinforced how critical it is to
						design with the user in mind, ensuring that their needs and pain points are addressed
						effectively.</li>
					<li><b>Collaboration is Key:</b> Working with a multidisciplinary team helped refine the design,
						allowing us to leverage diverse perspectives to create a more holistic solution.</li>
					<li><b>Iterative Design Process:</b> The iterative nature of design, from brainstorming to
						prototyping, allowed us to continuously improve and adapt the product based on feedback and
						testing.</li>
					<li><b>Design Systems:</b> Implementing a consistent design system not only streamlined development
						but also ensured a cohesive user experience across platforms.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In conclusion, this project has been an exciting journey of learning and growth, where I was able to
					apply my design skills to a real-world healthcare solution. It provided valuable insights into
					creating user-friendly, efficient, and impactful experiences for both patients and healthcare
					providers.</p>

				<p>I also worked on chatbots as part of the same project, which I’ve detailed in my <a
